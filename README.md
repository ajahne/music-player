# Music Player

## Purpose
To create an HTML5 Music Player to play audio on the web while further learning about audio and media.

## Goals

- plug and play (should be able to use on any site)
- built in vanilla js (no outside libs, frameworks, etc.)
- Stretch goal: once built, create react, angular, and vue versions (whew!)
